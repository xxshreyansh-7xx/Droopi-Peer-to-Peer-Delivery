Droopi: Peer-to-Peer Delivery application was created in 2020. It was created for the IOS mobile platform using swift. It allows easy food delivery and other items in closed campuses where third-party personnel isn’t allowed. Droopi has features that enable its users to place order requests. The order requests get sent to users close to the pick-up location and have a point bank system for successful deliveries. The application also allows in-app payments along with live tracking. 
Note: The project was completed in 2020 and is being added to my personal GitHub account in Dec ’22; all files are unchanged and are also available on the shared GitHub account of my team.
